Platformer game made with Godot

As part of assessment 1 set by Hami Te Momo, we were instructed
to make a platformer game with some restrictions.
we were instructed to use a certain player and certain ideas were encouraged.
we had full control over creativity making whatever we wanted as long as we showed competency in working with GODOT
