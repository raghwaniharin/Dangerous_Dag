Platformer game made with Godot

the purpose of the assignment was to familiarize ourselves with GODOT and to learn game design.
We also learnt how to design games to influence certain emotions on players which we then implemented in this game

As part of assessment 1 set by Hami Te Momo, we were instructed
to make a platformer game with some restrictions.
we were instructed to use a certain player and certain ideas were encouraged.
we had full control over creativity making whatever we wanted as long as we showed competency in working with GODOT
